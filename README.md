NostalgiaCraft
So yeah getting your grubby little hands on this project just became a bit harder to do...
Not impossible though!
I am posting a version of NostalgiaCraft on Archive.org
I am not sharing the link but I am sure you guys got your big boy pants on and can do it yourself?
Right?
Thanks for the support though! It really did make this whole project possible!

# UPDATE

This is important so listen up kiddos! Archive.org has just been unblocked in some districts but downloads for files still remain blocked.

This is good AND bad news:

This is mainly good news because there is a way to WGET files from the archive.org server!
and you are probably saying
WELL SAM... HOW IN THE HECKZIES WILL I EVER WGET ON A WEB BROWSER
introducing drumroll please...

# The Power of the Internet!! *Gitpod*

If you use python Django you should be able to open a terminal right in your browser!

Bad news:

Well Most kids my age don't even know what github is... so how do I expect them to make an account?
I don't.
But if you are smart enough you should be able to figure it out...
Y a y

Q&A

Q: Sam... what if Archive.org is still blocked?

A: You can try downloading it on your phone and put it in your drive so you can drag and drop the file!

Q: Is the anywhere else I can find this file?

A: No. If you find one somewhere other than my Archive do NOT touch it.

Q: What is a WGET?

A: Please just google it?

Q: What if Gitpod is blocked?

A: Oof, that is terrible! Do not fret! Try using Repl.it, and if that doesnt work refer to the first question.

Q: Will Nostalgiacraft ever upgrade to 1.8?

A: No.

Again thank you for the support!!
