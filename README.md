# NostalgiaCraft Update
Got DMCA'ed ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ is that going to stop me??? Yes... yes it will.

Sooo yeah... its no big secret that versions of Eaglercraft has been getting taken down
Including my very own modified version...
NostalgiaCraft
So yeah getting your grubby little hands on this project just became a bit harder to do...
Not impossible though!
I am posting a version of NostalgiaCraft on Archive.org
I am not sharing the link but I am sure you guys got your big boy pants on and can do it yourself?
Right?
Thanks for the support though! It really did make this whole project possible!
